## Introduction
Welcome to the Spam Classification project using BERT in Natural Language Processing (NLP). This project employs state-of-the-art techniques to classify text messages as spam or ham, enhancing your communication experience.

## Overview
Spam messages are a persistent problem in modern communication. In this project, we leverage BERT, a groundbreaking NLP model, and the transformative Transformer architecture to automatically filter spam messages. 

## BERT and Transformer
- BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) was introduced in the [original BERT paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) by Jacob Devlin and team.
- The Transformer architecture, which underlies BERT, revolutionized sequence-to-sequence models, as detailed in the [Transformer paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) by Vaswani et al.

## Getting Started
To dive into this project and start filtering spam:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run the provided code to train and evaluate the model.

## Preprocessing
Text data preparation is crucial for our model to shine:
1. Tokenization: The text is split into manageable units for BERT.
2. Padding: Text sequences are standardized to ensure consistent input dimensions.
3. Label Encoding: Spam and ham labels are encoded (e.g., spam: 1, ham: 0).

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:
- PyTorch
- Transformers library from Hugging Face
- Other necessary Python libraries as listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Usage
Run the provided code to train and evaluate the spam classification model. Customize it for your specific data and requirements.

## Acknowledgments
Our work is built on the contributions of researchers and developers in the NLP community. We express our gratitude for their remarkable efforts.

## Conclusion
This implentation serves more than just a spam-ham filter; it's a testament to the power of NLP, brought to life by BERT and the Transformer architecture showcasing advancing in Deep Learning, NLP, and Generative AI.
